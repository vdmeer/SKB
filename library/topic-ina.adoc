= Introduction to Network Architecture

Provide a list of papers, articles, books and the like important to understand network architecture:

* items in the list should be fundamantal to network architecure, not RINA (with the exception of the RINA heading).
* provide primary references only, no secondary references if possible
* provide links to get the item in public domain, if possible (papers should have a link, books might have a link)
* at least more more link to a description (e.g. Wikipedia, Goodreads, etc.) is preferable
* links should be labled, since this document in intended as an online document
* each item should have at least one co-author or contributor who has read it, no point in using "potentially" interesting items
* each item should start with Author(s), Title, Year
* alwas use full authore names, i.e. not abbreviated first names
