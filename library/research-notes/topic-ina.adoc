Provide a list of papers, articles, books and the like important to understand network architecture:

* items in the list should be fundamantal to network architecure, not RINA (with the exception of the RINA heading).
* provide primary references only, no secondary references if possible
* provide links to get the item in public domain, if possible (papers should have a link, books might have a link)
* at least more more link to a description (e.g. Wikipedia, Goodreads, etc.) is preferable
* links should be labled, since this document in intended as an online document
* each item should have at least one co-author or contributor who has read it, no point in using "potentially" interesting items
* each item should start with Author(s), Title, Year
* alwas use full authore names, i.e. not abbreviated first names

== History

It is usually not easy to understand scientific breakthroughs without their historic context.
This context is also important to understand not only when, but also how (and often why) ideas developed in a certain way.

=== Packet-switched Networks and CATENET
CATENET - concatenated networks, probably from Latin _catena_ (chain) - the first description of a packet-switched network architecture with an actual deployed network (CYCLADES).
Documents are listed in historic order.
