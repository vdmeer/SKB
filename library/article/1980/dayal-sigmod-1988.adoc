* Authors: U. Dayal, Barbara Blaustein, Alejandro Buchmann, Sharma Chakravarthy, Meichun Hsu, R. Ledin, D. McCarthy, Arnon Rosenthal, S. Sarin, M. J. Carey, Miron Livny, R. Jauhari
* Reasons to read: origin of Event Condition Action (ECA) rules
  ** Defines ECA rules – Event, Condition, Action
     *** Event triggers rule, i.e. condition evaluation
     *** Condition is set of queries
     *** Action is executed when rule is triggered and condition is satisfied
  ** Processing rules is strongly related to database transactions
  ** Two couplings are defined: E-C and C-A
  ** Event types: database operation, temporal, external notification
  ** Funded by DARPA
