*Richard W. Watson*: _Timer-based Mechanisms in reliable Transport Protocol Connection Management_, 1981

* Reasons to read: only 3 timers are needed, in the protocol, no local clocks and no clock synchronization required
* Original break-through happened in 1978, so some reference date it to 1978
* Also published as IEN193
* Published: Computer Networks (1976), Volume 5, Issue 1, February 1981, Pages 47-56
