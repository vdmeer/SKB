== My Research Library

I used to have several places for references and notes, from SQL databases to JSON and YAML files, and of course hand-written notes.
Now I am consolidating all of that in this library.

The organisation is relatively easy.
On the top level I have documents that group references and notes.
There is for instance `library.adoc` that contains all references.
Or `proceedings.adoc` that only has proceedings.
Most of these documents are named after BibLaTeX entry types.

Notes are grouped in files that start with `topic-`.
These documents contain discussions and other text, plus references.

All library items are then in the sub-directories.
Directory names are again BibLaTeX entry types, mostly.
For larger collections, for instance _in-proceedings_, I do use sub-directories for decades.

Individual items have the main author (or editor) name, a place (e.g. conference), and the year of publication.
Standards and patents are named slighly different (SDO plus year, filing place and publication number).

The Asciidoctor tool chain then allows to use thse files in various places.
I take my own publications for instance for my personal website.
Some of the topics I use there as well, as research notes.
And I do generate HTML versions and host them on my GH pages.
On my local server I also have a library with PDFs and other artifacts.
The build script `_build.sh` builds the files for me.

=== Compiled Versions

The main collections are the overall library, my own publications, and my research notes.

The other files are for entry types, mainly.
Talks are a bit different, here I separate keynotes from tutorials, invited talks, and other presentations.
