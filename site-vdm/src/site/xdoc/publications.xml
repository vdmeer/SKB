                Publications and presentations are part of research.
                For my first paper back in 1998, I was a co-author.
                I also had to present the paper at the conference.
                This was nerve-racking, somehow I managed.
                I got better in writing and presenting over time.

                The list here should be failry complete.
                I tried to provide as much information and links possible for each item.
                Most of them have links to full-text PDF versions, many hosted by <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sven_Van_der_Meer">ResearchGate</a>.
                If you can't find a full-text version let me know, I can provide them.
            </p>

                The lists here are generated from Asciidoc sources, all available on Github.
                I also have a complet list as HTML on my GH pages: <a href="https://vdmeer.github.io/library/vdm.html">full list</a>.
