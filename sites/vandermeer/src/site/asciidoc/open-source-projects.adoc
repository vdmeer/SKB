list of my open source projects

== SKB

The SKB is the entry point or umbrella for a number of my projects, all open source on Github.
SKB is short for _Sven's Knowledge Base_.
I was looking for some acronym (actually abbreviation, since one cannot speak SKB), and this is what I came up with a long time ago (sometimes in 2014 I guess).

It is hosted on Github in this link:https://github.com/vdmeer/skb[repository].
The repository contains my databases (acronyms, library, etc.), the source of the SKB website, the source of this website, and a Wiki.
