                I worked in academia (TU Berlin, WIT), research institutes (GMD/FhG FOKUS, TSSG), and industry (Ericsson).
                Across all organisations, work comprised research (projects), teaching and supervision, publications, talks and presentations, and conference organisation and reviews.
                The research projects are grouped by organisation.
                I used the same grouping for teaching and supervision.
                For publications, I tried to use the standard BiBLaTeX categories.
                Talks and publications are grouped by the main scope, e.g. a keynote or an invited talk.
