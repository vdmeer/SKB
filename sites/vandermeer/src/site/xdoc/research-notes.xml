                Sometimes in 2017 I started writing down notes on some research topics.
                Some are simply reading lists, some provide more of a discussion on a particular topic.
                Most of them are also available as stand-alone HTML documents on my GH pages.
                The source for all notes is on Github (in the SKB project).

It is a longer list of books and articles and papers, as well as other items, that help to understand network architectures. Beware, it is not the usual reading list, nor is this list part of any textbook I know of.</td>
