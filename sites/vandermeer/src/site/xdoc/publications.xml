                Publications and presentations are part of research.
                For my first paper back in 1998, I was a co-author.
                I also had to present the paper at the conference.
                This was nerve-racking, somehow I managed.
                I got better in writing and presenting over time.
            </p>

            <p class="narrow large">
                The list here should be failry complete.
                I tried to provide as much information and links possible for each item.
                Most of them have links to full-text PDF versions, many hosted by <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sven_Van_der_Meer">ResearchGate</a>.
                If you can't find a full-text version let me know, I can provide them.
            </p>

            <p class="narrow large">
                The list is also available as
                    standalone _HTML_ (link:https://vdmeer.github.io/skb/library/vdm.html[skb-web]) and
                    _PDF_ (link:https://vdmeer.github.io/skb/library/vdm.pdf[skb-web]).
