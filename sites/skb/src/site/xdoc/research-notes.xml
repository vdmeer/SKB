        <section name="Research Notes">
            <p class="narrow large">
                Sometimes in 2017 I started writing down notes on some research topics.
                Some are simply reading lists, some provide more of a discussion on a particular topic.
                Most of them are also available as stand-alone HTML and PDF documents on my GH pages.
                The source for all notes is on Github (in the SKB project).
