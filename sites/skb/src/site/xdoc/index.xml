                This is my knowledge base project.
                Since my name is Sven, it is called SKB.

                    Today, the SKB is the base project for a variety of different projects, e.g. Java developments, tests, LaTeX packages.
                    It also, on the main project, maintains my research library and some other data.
                    This data is in the source repository (as source) and on this site (and other sites) in a processed form.

                    It all started sometimes in the late 1990s, when I got my own domain (as a birthday present from very good friends).
                    We started web development, first static HTML, then PHP.
                    While working as a researcher and PhD student, I wanted to have a list of publications on my website.
                    Later acronyms, foto collection, diaries, and other 'stuff'.
                </p>
                <p class="narrow large">
                    Later in Ireland, I started programming and developing in Java.
                    Github became available, and I started hosting some projects on Github.
                    Those projects (PHP and Java), evolved, some I did not continue.
                    The PHP backend for my site was a lot of work.
                    It was very good for processing data at runtime, but it turned out to be hard to add new data (for instanc a new publication).
                    So sometimes around 2011 I stopped maintaining the data, thus the whole project and site hibernated.
                </p>
                <p class="narrow large">
                    In 2018 then I turned back to this problem, partially because I had an idea how to realize the whole set differently.
                    for our APEX engine (and earlier in some SKB Java projects), I had experimented with the Maven Site plugin.
                    I also used the Asciidoctor toolchain heavily.
                    Combining both seemed a good idea.
                    Then I found a way to maintain my data in a non-proprietary form (text files) that also allows to process them for other purposes (such as a website).
                    And now we are here.
