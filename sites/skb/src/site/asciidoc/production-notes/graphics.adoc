I started using ACDSee when many other graphic tools were either too simple ot too expensive.
Staid with it over the years, still using it for manipulating bitmaps.

_Microsoft Image Composer_, excellent application to combine multiple images (photos) into a larger composition.
License is commercial, but application is free to use.

In my opinion the best application to draw SVG vector graphics.
I use it for years now, and exclusively for all SVG graphics.

A nice graphic editor with lots of features and functions.
I usually take yED to show graphs, and to edit GraphML.
