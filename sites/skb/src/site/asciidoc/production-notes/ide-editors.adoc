| link:https://www.eclipse.org/[Eclipse] | 2019-03 | Eclipse |
My main IDE for Java development. I use it also for managing projects, and editing other source files (`bash`, `json`, `yaml`).
The plugins I am using are listed in the table below.
For some projects I created otherwise empty `POM` files to simplify import into Eclipse.

| link:https://www.texstudio.org/[TeXStudio] | 2.12.6 | GPL 3 |
For everything TeX and LaTeX.
It comes with everything you need for large documents: code completion, spell-checking, build (including BibTeX, biber, and makeidx).

| link:https://www.ultraedit.com/products/uestudio/[UltraStudio] | 19 | commercial |
My general purpose text editor, with a few nice functions such as column editing, data sort, and support for coding.
Comes also with an excellent compare and find tool for Windows.

| link:https://www.vim.org/[vi(m)] | 8 | |
On Linux systems, the main editor I am using.
I don't have much configuration or functions for it though.
