        * Reasons to read: origin of Event Condition Action (ECA) rules
          ** Defines ECA rules â€“ Event, Condition, Action
             *** Event triggers rule, i.e. condition evaluation
             *** Condition is set of queries
             *** Action is executed when rule is triggered and condition is satisfied
          ** Processing rules is strongly related to database transactions
          ** Two couplings are defined: E-C and C-A
          ** Event types: database operation, temporal, external notification
          ** Funded by DARPA
        * Published: ACM SIGMOD Record - Special Issue on Real-Time Database Systems, Volume 17 Issue 1, March, 1988, Pages 51 - 70
