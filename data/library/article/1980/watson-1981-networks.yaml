        * Reasons to read: only 3 timers are needed, in the protocol, no local clocks and no clock synchronization required
        * Original break-through happened in 1978, first paper "Mechanisms for a reliable timer-based protocol"
        * Also published as IEN193
        * Published: Computer Networks (1976), Volume 5, Issue 1, February 1981, Pages 47-56
