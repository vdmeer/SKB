    ** Quote: "This outcome [...] has been named 'recreating the Turing Machine' syndrome [Miller]: starting from a computationally clean and semantically motivated language, one tends to add external mechanisms in order to make it suitable for programming-in-the-large. This inevitably tends to clutter the formal definition of the language (if any), making trusting the language itself and thus reasoning about it problematic."
